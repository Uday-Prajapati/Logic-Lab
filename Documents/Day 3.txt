1) Expression Evaluator (No eval)
Objective: Parse and evaluate a simple arithmetic expression string like "12 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 2".
Requirements

Support + - * / with correct precedence (* / > + -).
Tokenize the input string using loops and string methods only.
Disallow floating-point; perform integer arithmetic (truncate division).
Use a method int evaluate(String expr) that returns the result.
Use Integer.parseInt, Character.isDigit (wrapper class utilities).
Use at least one for loop and one while loop; use continue to skip spaces.
Validate input; if invalid, print a message and exit gracefully.

Input (console)
12 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 2

Output
Result: 21

Constraints

No external libraries; no ScriptEngine.
Comment your tokenizer and parser logic with clear block comments.
Follow naming conventions and small, cohesive methods.


2) Command-Line Gradebook

Provide menu:

Print all
Print topper
Class average
Search by name (case-insensitive)
Curve grades by +5 (cap at 100)
Exit


Implement each option in a separate method.

Thursday

Constraints

Clear comments for formula steps.
Use if-else and arithmetic operators carefully.
No library date classes.


6) Compressed Run-Length Encoding (RLE) with Options

Requirements

Menu:

1) Compress
2) Decompress
3) Exit


Compress rule: "aaabbc" → "a3b2c1".
Decompress rule: "a3b2c1" → "aaabbc".
Validate input (letters only in compress; correct format in decompress).
Use StringBuilder and wrapper class parsing (Character.isDigit, Integer.parseInt for counts).
Use for loop with continue to skip invalid chars.

Sample Input/Output
1
aaabbc
a3b2c1
